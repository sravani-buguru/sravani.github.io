### Projects
### ZOMATO_EDA_PROJECT:
https://github.com/sravani-buguru/ZOMATO_EDA_PROJECT/
# Description: 
Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, consisting of information about restaurants all over the World. The analysis included data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation of key insights.

Used Data Analysis for Cleaning, wrangling, and exploration of large datasets.

Used Data Visualization for Creating insightful graphs and charts using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

Performed Statistical Analysis for Calculating descriptive statistics and identifying correlations between variables.

# Project Highlights:
Identified the top 3 countires that use Zomato the most and Identified top 5 states from India that uses more Zomato.

Analyzed the relationship between cuisine, cost per person, and restaurant rating.

Investigated the impact of various factors like  online ordering ,customer ratings etc.

Developed interactive visualizations to explore the data and communicate findings effectively.
# Technologies Used: 
Python

### PIMA_INDIANS_DIABETES_PROJECT:
https://github.com/sravani-buguru/PIMA_INDIANS_DIABETES/
# Description:
Developed and implemented machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women. Utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which consists of clinical measurements and a binary outcome variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

Machine Learning for Applied supervised learning algorithms to build predictive models.

By using Data Preprocessing ,Cleaned and transformed data for model training.

Used Feature Engineering for Creating additional features to improve model performance.

By Model Evaluation,Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Project Highlights:
Successfully implemented various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Achieved an accuracy of over 80% in predicting diabetes onset.

Performed feature selection and engineered new features to improve model performance.

Analyzed and interpreted feature importance to understand the key factors contributing to diabetes
