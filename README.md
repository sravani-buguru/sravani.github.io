### ZOMATO_EDA_PROJECT:
https://github.com/sravani-buguru/ZOMATO_EDA_PROJECT/
Description: 
Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, consisting of information about restaurants all over the World. The analysis included data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation of key insights.
Used Data Analysis for Cleaning, wrangling, and exploration of large datasets.
Used Data Visualization for Creating insightful graphs and charts using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
Performed Statistical Analysis for Calculating descriptive statistics and identifying correlations between variables.
Project Highlights:
Identified the top 3 countires that use Zomato the most and Identified top 5 states from India that uses more Zomato.
Analyzed the relationship between cuisine, cost per person, and restaurant rating.
Investigated the impact of various factors like  online ordering ,customer ratings etc.
Developed interactive visualizations to explore the data and communicate findings effectively.
Technologies Used: 
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

### PIMA_INDIANS_DIABETES_PROJECT:
https://github.com/sravani-buguru/PIMA_INDIANS_DIABETES/
  
  The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, contains information of 768 women . The outcome tested was Diabetes, 258 tested positive and 500 tested negative. Therefore, there is one target (dependent) variable and the 8 attributes: pregnancies, OGTT(Oral Glucose Tolerance Test), blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI(Body Mass Index), age, pedigree diabetes function. The Pima population has been under study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at intervals of 2 years since 1965. As epidemiological evidence indicates that T2DM results from interaction of genetic and environmental factors, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset includes information about attributes that could and should be related to the onset of diabetes and its future complications.
