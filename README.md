### ZOMATO_EDA_PROJECT:
https://github.com/sravani-buguru/ZOMATO_EDA_PROJECT/

Zomato API Analysis is one of the most useful analysis for foodies who want to taste the best cuisines of every part of the world which lies in their budget. This analysis is also for those who want to find the value for money restaurants in various parts of the country for the cuisines. Additionally, this analysis caters the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the country and which locality of that country serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants.
-Downloaded restaurant data from Kaggle website for more than 10000 restaurants across world. 
-Ingested this data ,found missing values, normalize revenue numbers to standard format using python,Pandas, jupyter notebook along with some other statistical techniques by using Numpy
-For analysis of  restaurants used Excel. For Visulization used Matplotlib and Seaborn .
-Figured out India(94.39%) has more Zomato transactions following up by United States(4.73%) and Uinted Kingdom(0.87%).


### PIMA_INDIANS_DIABETES_PROJECT:
  The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, contains information of 768 women . The outcome tested was Diabetes, 258 tested positive and 500 tested negative. Therefore, there is one target (dependent) variable and the 8 attributes: pregnancies, OGTT(Oral Glucose Tolerance Test), blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI(Body Mass Index), age, pedigree diabetes function. The Pima population has been under study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at intervals of 2 years since 1965. As epidemiological evidence indicates that T2DM results from interaction of genetic and environmental factors, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset includes information about attributes that could and should be related to the onset of diabetes and its future complications.
